                Hello, My name is Samuel and I'm a beginner web developer.
                I've wanted to learn to code since I was around 16.
                Unfortunately, I was unable to really get into programming until my early adult years.
                My sister reccomended I check out two websites to practice coding: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>
                W3Schools was a good start but didn't give me the chance for some hands on coding experience.
                Udemy, on the other hand, has helped me learn more practical, usable, coding skills and techniques.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm a heard working, patient, fast learner who'll sit down and get the job done.
                I work well in all environments and can adapt my skills however they're needed.
            </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I have a year of basic college education out of the way and have been self teaching programming in the downtime between semesters.
                I'm currently working through some Udemy coding courses to practice backend web and app development.
            </p>
        <h2>Work experience</h2>
            <p>
                I work in a fast paced environment leading a team to carry out our tasks and responsibilities quickly and efficiently.
                I work well with others and will be a great asset to have on your team.
            </p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
